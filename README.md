For this exercise, implement the following steps:
Navigate to https://www.gamesforthebrain.com/game/checkers/
Confirm that the site is up
Make five legal moves as orange:
a)      Include taking a blue piece
b)      Use “Make a move” as confirmation that you can take the next step
c)      Restart the game after five moves
d)      Confirm that the restarting had been successful
You’ll find that the game engine is predictable enough to allow for you to win a game reliably. So, you can try for this if you’re inclined and have a little time left over.
